Task 3: Writing Basic SELECT Queries

Objective
The goal of this task was to practice and demonstrate proficiency in writing SQL queries to extract, filter, and sort data from a relational database. This task was completed using 'MySQL Workbench' as the tool.

Overview of Work Done
This project showcases the following SQL skills:
1. Retrieving Data: Extracting data using 'SELECT' statements, both for all columns and specific columns.
2. Filtering Data: Applying 'WHERE' clauses with conditions like 'AND', 'OR', 'LIKE', and 'BETWEEN'.
3. Sorting Results: Ordering data with 'ORDER BY' in both ascending and descending orders.
4. Aggregating Data: Using functions such as 'AVG' and 'MAX' to summarize data.
5. Limiting Results: Restricting the number of rows displayed using 'LIMIT'.

Tools Used
- Database Management Tools: DB Browser for SQLite and MySQL Workbench.
- Database Schema: A table named 'Employees' containing attributes such as 'first_name', 'last_name', 'sal' (salary), 'birth_day', and 'branch_id'.

Key Achievements
Successfully extracted and manipulated data using 15 SQL queries.
Demonstrated the ability to filter and aggregate data for meaningful insights.
Achieved clarity and precision in sorting and limiting results.
Created queries that can handle real-world use cases, such as identifying top performers or analyzing salary distributions.
